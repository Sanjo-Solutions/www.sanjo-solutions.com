  ## Consulting

  I can potentially consult you. Via consciousness calibrations it can be possible under certain condition to efficiently arrive at answers in many domains.

  ### How does it work?

  Via a consciousness calibration technique the level of truth of hypotheses can be discerned under certain conditions.

  With that, truth can be identified and that which is fallacious can be avoided. This can save a lot of time and resources compared to a trial and error approach.
